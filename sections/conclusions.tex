Overall we were very satisfied with the results. After all the hard work that was put in to this robot it was a really nice to end it with winning the competition. 
Some things we have learned along the road are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Working with real world problems is time consuming and can sometimes be quite frustrating.
\item Try to work agile and don't get stuck on one idea or approach becuase the idea you initially thought would be bad might be the winning ticket.
\item Go for the general solution. For us, using the path planner was hard to get working but once it was finnished, it solved quite alot. Following the wall was easy but in the end that solution turned out to be more complex for us.
\item Talk and integrate both socially and in the code. Sometimes you just need to small talk a few minutes to solve a problem you had for hours.
\item It is really important to start early. In a project as large as this, if you do everything the last day before a milestone. You will not have acceptable code to work with the following day.
\end{itemize}
