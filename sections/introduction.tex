This report describes the work done for the final project for the course Robotics and Autonomous systems. The purpose is to reflect about ideas and solutions we provided in order to try to reach the goal of this course â€“ making autonomous robot that can explore maze, create map of it and detect and recognize different geometrical objects located in maze.

The report is structured as follows. Section \ref{sec:mechanics} describes the components and mechanical design. Section \ref{sec:control} presents the solution for motion control. The intelligence of the robot is explained in Section \ref{sec:software}. In addition, Section \ref{sec:vision} describes the computer vision algorithms. Finally, a performance evaluation and conclusions are presented in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.
