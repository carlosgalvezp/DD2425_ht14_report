Robot size is 23 cm x 23 cm width and length (including wheels) and 29 cm height. Same width and length were chosen due to ease of maneuverability. For the same reason wheels are located in the middle of its sides and corners of the robot are cut off in 45\u8 angle. Two aluminium plates are connected with pillars in such way making two floors. On the first floor are located motors, acumulator battery and speaker whereas on the second floor is located NUC and Arduino sandwitch. For camera there is pillar which raises it high enough so it reaches 29 cm height. IMU is located under the second plate as well as long range IR sensors which points to front and back direction. Short range IR sensors are located on the pillars which connect first and second floor.
