\subsection{Results}

Here we make a summarize of strengths and weaknesses of our system.
\begin{itemize}
\item Motor control: Not perfect but satisfactory.
\item Navigation: Could have been improved, path not always the shortest.
\item Mapping: Worked great. Did not have time to fully test with localization.
\item Vision: Worked really well except problems with illumination.
\item Odometry: We had some drifting problems but relative to other groups it seemed to work really good.
\item Obstacle avoidance: worked really well. Seldom did we see a crash during the last week of work.
\item Localization: Our weekest part. Never really worked except from start. 
\end{itemize}
