\subsubsection{Calibration}

Because of non-linear sensor output vs distance curve it is not practical to use raw values from IR sensors in higher level nodes. Therefore it was needed to create node which converts raw data from sensors to distance. As the raw output changes values more rapidly in lower distances, measurements in low range were made quite densely (by measuring sensor output every 0.5 cm) whereas in longer distances such accuracy were not needed because output values were approximately the same even within 5 cm range. Sensor converter node is the only one which subscribes to raw sensors node and other nodes in ROS subscribes directly to distance data.
